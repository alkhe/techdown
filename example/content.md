## Definitions

_**Price**_: Sale price of one unit of good.
$P$
$\overbar{hello}$
_**Quantity**_: Quantity demanded or supplied of a good.
$Q$

_**Fixed Cost**_: Cost of production due to fixed factors (e.g. rent, salaries, property taxes, marketing).
$C_0$

_**Variable Cost**_: Cost of production that varies with amount of good produced (e.g. raw materials, sales commissions, utilities).
$C_V$

_**Total Benefit**_: Returns from selling goods. Also known as ***Total Revenue***.
$B = P \cdot Q$

_**Total Cost**_: Cost of producing goods.
$C = C_0 + C_V$

_**Total Profit**_: Excess of benefit over cost.
$\Pi = B - C$

_**Marginal Benefit**_: Additional benefit from producing unit ***Q*** (equivalent to ***Price***).
$MB = \frac{\partial B}{\partial Q} = P$

_**Marginal Cost**_: Additional cost from producing unit ***Q***. Tends to increase with ***Q***.
$MC = \frac{\partial C}{\partial Q}$

_**Marginal Profit**_: Additional profit from producing unit ***Q***. also known as ***Economic Surplus***.
$M\Pi = \frac{\partial \Pi}{\partial Q} = MB - MC$

_**Average Benefit**_: Benefit per unit of good produced (equivalent to ***Price***).
$AB = \frac{B}{Q} = P$

_**Average Fixed Cost**_: Cost of Fixed Factors per unit of good produced. Approaches ***0*** as ***Q*** increases.
$AC_0 = \frac{C_0}{Q}$

_**Average Variable Cost**_: Cost of Variable Factors per unit of good produced. Approaches ***Average Cost*** as ***Q*** increases.
$AC_V = \frac{C_V}{Q}$

_**Average Cost**_: Cost per unit of good produced.
$AC = \frac{C}{Q} = AC_V + AC_0$

_**Average Profit**_: Profit per unit of good produced.
$A\Pi = \frac{\Pi}{Q} = AB - AC$

> ## Shutdown Conditions
>
> Generally, a business is profitable if its revenue exceeds the costs. However, in the short run, all fixed costs are sunk costs, so businesses will sometimes continue to run at a loss if the profit of production is greater than the profit of shutdown.
